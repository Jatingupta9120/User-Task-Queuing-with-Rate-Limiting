This project implements a Node.js-based API that handles task submissions with rate limiting and queuing functionality. The API enforces the following rate limits for each user:

1 task per second
20 tasks per minute
When the rate limit is exceeded, tasks are queued and processed according to the rate limits. Task completion details, including user ID and timestamp, are logged into a file for auditing purposes.

Features
Rate Limiting: Each user is allowed 1 task per second and up to 20 tasks per minute. Exceeding these limits results in the task being queued for later execution.
Task Queuing: Tasks that exceed rate limits are queued using Bull, a popular job and task queue library.
Task Logging: Task completion is logged into a file (task_logs.txt), which contains the user ID and timestamp of each task.
Node.js Clustering: The app uses Node.js clustering to scale horizontally across multiple CPU cores for better performance under load.
Prerequisites
To run the application locally, you'll need:

Node.js (v14 or higher)
Redis (for task queuing and rate limiting)
A terminal or command-line interface (CLI) for running the application

Key Files:
server.js: Main entry point to the application, sets up the Express server and clustering.
config.js: Configuration file for setting various parameters (port, rate limits, Redis connection).
taskController.js: Controller to handle incoming task submission requests.
rateLimiter.js: Logic for checking whether a user has exceeded the rate limit.
taskQueue.js: Bull queue that processes tasks asynchronously.
logger.js: Service to handle task completion logging.
Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
2. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
3. Start Redis
Make sure Redis is running on your local machine or on a Redis server. You can download and start Redis by following the instructions on the Redis website.

To run Redis locally:

bash
Copy code
redis-server
4. Start the Application
To start the application, run:

bash
Copy code
node src/server.js
This will start the server on port 3000 (you can change the port in config.js if needed).

5. Testing the API
You can test the /submit-task/:userId API using a tool like Postman or curl.

Example request using curl:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/submit-task/123 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"taskData": "Process user task"}'
Sample response:
json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Task has been queued successfully.",
  "userId": "123",
  "taskData": "Process user task"
}
If the user exceeds the rate limit (e.g., submitting more than 1 task per second), the server will respond with a 429 status code and a message that the task has been queued:

json
Copy code
{
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Task has been queued and will be processed shortly."
}
6. Check Task Logs
After a task is processed, the task completion details are logged in the task_logs.txt file. The log format is:

Copy code
123-task completed at-1632991626342
124-task completed at-1632991645867
How It Works
Rate Limiting:
Rate limiting is enforced using Redis. Each user is assigned rate-limiting counters that track the number of tasks they have submitted in the last second and the last minute. If a user exceeds the allowed limit, the task is queued instead of being processed immediately.

The rate limits are:

1 task per second
20 tasks per minute
Task Queuing:
Tasks are added to a queue when the rate limit is exceeded. The tasks are processed asynchronously by the Bull queue. Each task is processed in the order it was queued, and the task details are logged once processed.

Clustering:
Node.js clustering is used to fork multiple processes, one for each available CPU core. This allows the server to handle a higher volume of requests and scale more efficiently.

Logging:
When a task is processed, the task_logs.txt file is updated with a log entry that includes the user ID and the timestamp of the task. The log entries are written using fs.appendFileSync to avoid race conditions and ensure tasks are logged sequentially.
